This is a live stream application built on nodejs. It is currently 90% of the approach employed by Waleed Ahmad in his similar work. I only fixed a couple of bugs and adjustments so it can work on my machine. I intend to use Angular for the front end, not the react used by Waleed Ahmad. Here is the link to Waleed's similar work where he used react as frontend. https://github.com/waleedahmad/node-stream/ . 

My major change is to use node-ffmpeg-installer unlike Waleed's approach. This helped to solve some errors and make it possible for me to run the app effectively on my windows machine. 

My continuous improvement on this application and use of Angular as the frontend will not be on this public repo. Feel free to contact me to give you access to the private repo with that implementation.
