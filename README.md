This is a live stream application built on nodejs. It is currently 90% of the approach employed by Waleed Ahmad in his similar work. I only fixed a couple of bugs and adjustments so it can work on my machine. I intend to use Angular for the front end, not the react used by Waleed Ahmad. Here is the link to Waleed's similar work where he used react as frontend. https://github.com/waleedahmad/node-stream/ .
